  A local file system based cache used primarily for POP3 folders.
  Uses a filesystem directory to represent a {@link javax.mail.Folder}.
  {@link javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage} instances that belong to the
  {@link javax.mail.Folder} are stored as separate files under the directory
  with the <code>UID</code> as the file name for the message.  Folder
  metadata is stored under the directory as a <code>folder.xml</code> file.
